# Codewars

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is a very popular website for testing your programming skills using a variety of programming languages. It offers numerous programming challenges that test your knowledge of the fundamentals as well as algorithms and data structures.

I have been practicing with Codewars and other websites for quite some time. I am starting from scratch again, however, and will be adding the solutions to this repository in a variety of languages.

## C

During the summer of 2017 I visited Salt Lake City, Utah. I joined a meetup in Lehi that was teaching computer science using the C programming language. Although I have self-taught myself a great deal of computer science and know C#, I had never learned C. Therefore, I joined the meetup and attended the weekly meetings.

C offered a number of challenges, and I really enjoyed learning it. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased a C Course on Udemy and quickly devoured the language in a few weeks.

As I have done for several programming languages, I began solving programming challenges on Codewars to continually test my skills. Currently I am ranked 6 kyu.

Since ranking up to 6 kyu, I have slowed my practice to focus on learning Go, which has a lot of similarities with C. I feel I've learned about all I need to know from C and can apply that knowledge to Go.
